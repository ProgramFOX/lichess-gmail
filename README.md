### Extra gmail features to better help lichess users

Install as an unpacked chrome extension.

### Commands:

#### `Ctrl+i`

For email confirmation requests. This shortcut:

- opens the [lichess email confirmation UI](https://github.com/ornicar/lila/wiki/Handling-email-address-confirmation) in a new tab, with the email loaded
- prepares a gmail reply with the corresponding canned response, in case the email confirmation succeeded
- changes our sending email from `contact@lichess.org` to `lichess.contact@gmail.com`, in case the user's email provider blocks `lichess.org` (it happens).

#### `Ctrl+y`

Opens lichess search user page, with the sender email.
